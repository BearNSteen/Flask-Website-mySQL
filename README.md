# Flask-Database
 This project was created as a collaboration with another student. It is a website representing a fictional game rental store from the 2000s, like Blockbuster. The site is written in Python using Flask and Jinja2 templating. The backend was supported using PHP, for which the credentials have been removed for GitHub. There is a separate page for Games, Consoles, Rentals, and Customers. The user can type in details, press Add, and the mySQL query will be sent off to the PHP database. It has all CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and they are all functional. It also has a sorting feature where you may type in any of the given fields and the tables will be updated as such.
